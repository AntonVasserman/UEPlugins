# UEPlugins

Centralized Repository for all my personal Unreal Engine Plugins

# Installation Guide

Since my plugins aren't Marketplace plugins, adding them needs to be done manually.

To do so follow the next steps:
1. Choose which Plugin you want to use from the `PluginsPackaged` folder, and extract the plugin from its ZIP format.
2. Copy the plugin folder inside (e.g. if you unpacked `AVCharacterFallV1.0`, inside it is the `AVCharacterFall` folder)
3. Paste it in your projects Plugins folder (e.g. if you have a project `CursedLands` go to `CursedLands/Plugins`)
4. Right-click on your project's `uproject` file and choose `Generate Visual Studio Project Files`
5. In your project's build C# file (e.g. `CursedLands.Build.cs`) add the plugin as a Public/Private dependency
6. [OPTIONAL] If for any reason the plugin isn't visible, in the Unreal Editor go to `Edit -> Plugins` and make sure the plugin is checked
